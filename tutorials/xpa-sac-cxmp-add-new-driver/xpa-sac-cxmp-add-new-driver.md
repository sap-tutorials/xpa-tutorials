### Create Driver member
First you need to create a new dimension member in the `Driver` dimension.
  
1. Open the `Marketing Planning` data model `SAP_MKT_IM_MarketingPlanning` and click on the `Driver` dimension in the dimension list on the left-hand side.

2. Add a new member ID to the dimension and save your changes.
    - In this example, we will create a new driver to be able to plan season based fluctuations. We will call this driver `Seasonal Impact` and provide the member ID `seasonalImpact`.
    - Save your changes afterwards.

### Create Calculated Measure 
Add a new calculated measure representing the incremental quantity coming from the new driver

1. Click on the `+` icon on the top to create a new calculated measure 
2. Provide a fitting **Name** and **Description** in the Properties panel on the right-hand side
3. <p>Add the formula according to the screenshot</p>
   
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](1/4.png)

    ```
    LOOKUP([QUANTITY], [d/Driver]="" AND [d/SAP_MKT_MarketingActivity]="#" AND [d/SAP_MKT_MarketingCampaign]="#" AND[d/SpendType]="#", [d/t.S:SAP_ALL_PLANT] )
    ```

4. Save your changes

### Adjust Data Actions

1. Enter the Data Action `SAP_MKT_IM_MarketingPlanning_PopulateImpactPercentage`

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    This data action is executed on initialization of the **Marketing Demand Planning** story and populates all relevant records with booked values, i.e. zeroes for all relevant measures.

2. In step 1 `Populate Quantities with booked Values`, add a new line according to the screenshot
   
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](1/5.png)

    ```
    DATA.APPEND([d/Driver]="seasonalImpact")=(RESULTLOOKUP()/RESULTLOOKUP())-1
    ```

3. In step 2 `Populate Revenues with booked Values`, add a new line according to the screenshot
   
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](1/6.png)

    ```
    DATA.APPEND([d/Driver]="seasonalImpact")=(RESULTLOOKUP([d/Measures]="QUANTITY")/RESULTLOOKUP([d/Measures]="QUANTITY"))-1
    ```

4. In step 3 `Populate Quantity Impact (%) with booked Values `, add a new line according to the screenshot

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](1/7.png)

    ```
    DATA.APPEND([d/Driver]="seasonalImpact",[d/t.S:SAP_ALL_PLANT]="#")=(RESULTLOOKUP([d/Measures]="QUANTITY")/RESULTLOOKUP([d/Measures]="QUANTITY"))-1
    ```

5. Save the Data Action

### Adjust Marketing Demand Planning Story

1. Open the story **Marketing Demand Planning** (`SAP_MKT_MarketingDemandPlanning`) in edit mode

2. Open the **Left Side Panel**, go to the **Outline** tab, look for the object called `tbl_DriversTable`, click on it and open the **Right Side Panel** to enter the **Builder** panel.
   
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](1/8.png)
