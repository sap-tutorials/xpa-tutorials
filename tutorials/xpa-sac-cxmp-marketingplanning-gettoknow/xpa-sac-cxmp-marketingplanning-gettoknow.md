    - In order to do so, please use the keyword `xP&A` or `CX`
    - In the result list, click on the folder `SAP_CX_Commercial_Planning` with the description `xP&A â€“ Commercial Planning`

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - In order for this step to work, you must set up the Multi Action and integration job first. 
    - If you wish to learn how to set up the integration process for price data, check the tutorials [xP&A Commercial Planning - Data Integration](xpa-sac-cx-data-integration-setup) and [xP&A Commercial Planning - Manage data loads](xpa-sac-cx-manage-data-loads).
    - Please note that you may skip this step in case you want to go with the provided demo data first. This step will only become necessary once you decide to use your own systems as data source. 


2. Click on the **Load Baseline Quantities** trigger to integrate baseline quantities into the data model

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](5/6.png)

    - By clicking on the trigger, a Multi Action is executed which loads baseline quantities from **SAP Integrated Business Planning** into the data model of this content package. 

    >INFORMATION:

    - Please note that you may skip this step in case you want to go with the provided demo data first. This step will only become necessary once you decide to use your own systems as data source. 


3. Click on the **Load COGS Rates** trigger to integrate cost rates into the data model

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](5/7.png)

    - By clicking on the trigger, a Data Action is executed which loads COGS rates from the product cost data model outside the content package (`SAP_FI_IFP_IM_ProductCost`) into the data model of this content package. 

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - In order for this step to work, you must have access to the product cost model `SAP_FI_IFP_IM_ProductCost`. 
    - Check out the official documentation for the business content package [Integrated Financial Planning for SAP S/4HANA (xP&A - Integrated Financial Planning for SAP S/4HANA and S/4HANA Cloud)](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/48f4b4785b8e45938ac44a67be8032d9/7ce894bc95f449779fa19d076e67c925.html?q=SAP_FI_IFP_Financial_Planning%20).

<!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](5/9.png)

- In the previous step you learned how to load in baseline quantities, COGS rates and list prices.
- By clicking on the trigger, a Data Action is executed which now calculates the total revenue and costs based on the imported figures for each product. 
 
>INFORMATION:
>
- This is required because neither total revenues nor total costs are imported from an external system. 
- Thus these figures are calculated inside SAP Analytics Cloud now by using this Data Action.
- The Data Action takes the imported quantities and multiplies the quantities by the list prices and COGS rates. The results are then persisted on the amount (`AMOUNT`) measure, which stores the total revenue or COGS.

### Marketing Budget Planning
As you have now integrated all relevant data and initialized your plan version, you can continue with the actual planning activities.

In this step, the **Marketing Budget Planning** (`SAP_MKT_MarketingBudgetPlanning`) story of this content package is introduced.

You will learn how to open the story (Tab 1) and how to enter your budget(Tab 2).

[OPTION BEGIN [Open Story]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Open Story**. This tab provides guidance on how to open the **Marketing Budget Planning** (`SAP_MKT_MarketingBudgetPlanning`) story.

1. Click on the burger menu located on the top left corner of the **Marketing Planning Admin Page** (`SAP_MKT_Marketing_AdminPage`) from the previous step.
2. Now click on either **Marketing Planning** to jump back to the **Marketing Planning Overview Page** or on **Marketing Budget Planning** to directly access the **Marketing Budget Planning** story.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/1.png)
   
    In this particular case, we will go back to the **Marketing Planning Overview Page** by clicking on the **Marketing Planning** button.

3. Click on the link **Marketing Budget Planning** to enter the story.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/2.png)

4. Get an overview of the application

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/3.png)

    - When you enter the story for the very first time, you will probably be confronted with an entirely empty application with the widgets not displaying anything. This is because the `Budget` version is initially empty and must be initialized by you. Before you do that, let's take a look at the structure of the story first. 

    - Generally the story consists of three sections. 
    - The header section provides three charts showing the the Investment Rate in percent, the Revenue by period and the Spend by period. 
    - The context for all charts is defined by the filters set in the input controls on the left-hand side of the story. 
    - The Investment Rate (%) is a measure which shows the portion of marketing expenses as compared to the revenue. 
    - The Revenue per Date chart shows the budgeted gross revenue per year. The green (positive deviation) or respectively red (negative deviation) bar serves as an indicator for the difference to the `Financial Target` version which the `Budget` version is based on.
    - The Spend per Date chart shows the budgeted marketing expenses per year. The green or respectively red bar serves as an indicator for the difference to the `Financial Target` version which the `Budget` version is based on.

    - The second important section is the filter section, which can be found on the left-hand side of the application. 
    - The filter panel provides different input controls in which you can define your planning context for this story.

    - The last important section is the planning section in the center of the story. 
    - The planning table is the place where you can enter your revenue and your marketing expense budget. 
    - The informational measure **Amount(GC) vs Financial Target (GC)** shows the deviation between your budgeted revenue and the revenue budget provided by the `Financial Target` version.
    - Additional measures can be added to the planning table via the **Table Settings** dialogue if desired. 
  
You may now switch to the second tab **Enter Budget Data** to learn how to enter your planning assumptions.

[OPTION END]


[OPTION BEGIN [Enter Budget Data]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Enter Budget Data**. This tab provides guidance on how to initialize your budget version and how to modify the budget afterwards.

1. Adjust your filters in the filter panel.
   
    - According to the **Steps** description field, start your activities by adjusting your filters in the filter panel if required. 
    
    >INFORMATION:
    >
    For the following demonstration, we will change the date filter to the years 2023 and 2024. 

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/41.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - All filters apart from the date filter are preset manually and are static as a result.
    - If you want to change your default settings for the filters, please go into edit mode of the story and change the selection of the input controls. 
    - The date filter on the other hand uses a tiny script and always sets the current year and the next year as default. As this tutorial was published in 2023, the date filter is set to the year 2023 and 2024. 
    - Check out the tutorial [xP&A Commercial Planning - Customize Default Settings](xpa-sac-cx-customize-default-settings) to learn in detail how to customize your default settings.

2. Initialize your Budget version

    - Click on the button **Initialize Version** to fill your budget version with data.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/5.png)

    - After clicking on the button, a dialogue pops up where you need to define the time horizon you want to populate.
    - In this case, we want to populate the Budget version for the years `2023` and `2024`. Click on **Start** to start the initialization process.
    
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/6.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - The budget version is initialized by copying over data from the `Financial Target` version.
    - The `Financial Target` version is predefined and serves as a sort of high-level budget provided by the financial department or upper management. 

3. Add additional measures to table

    - Click on the button **Table Settings** located on the top-right corner above the table.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/7.png)

    - A pop-up shows up. Select all measures and click on **Apply**.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/8.png)

    - You should now be able to see the revenue in both global and local currency inside the table. 
    - In addition to that you can also see the quantity as a read-only measure.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/9.png)

4. Adjust the revenue budget

    - You can now adjust the revenue budget based on global or local currency, this is completely up to you.
    - Expand the G/L Account structure to see all account members on which you can plan. In the scope of this content package, we only have the accounts **Revenue Domestic** and **Marketing Expenses** that requires budgeting. 
    - To edit the revenue and marketing expense budget, simply click on any editable cell and change the value.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/10.png)

    - If you want to distribute the marketing expense budget based on the ratio of your revenue budget, you can do so by using SAC standard functionality. 
    - To do so, simply copy the revenue value of a cell and paste it into the expense cell on the same data record. Please note that this is only possible on a single member level though - you cannot copy and paste node values. In this particular example, you need to expand the account dimension in the table and copy the value under the account member `Revenue Domestic - Product` as shown in the screenshot.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/11.png)

    - Now, both revenue budget and marketing expense budget should have the same number across all records. 
    - Afterwards, edit the value inside the cell where you just pasted the revenue value into. SAC will automatically take over the distribution of the budget based on the revenue or respectively based on the values that you have just pasted. 

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/13.png)

    - In this example, the marketing expenses were adjusted from a value of `500.000.000` to `50.000.000`, which is exactly 10 % of the revenue budget. As you can see, the distribution of the overall marketing expense budget among the company codes is precisely the same as for the revenue budget with `Company Code 1010` having around 32 % of the overall budget, `Company Code 1710` having around 40.5 % of the overall budget and `Company Code 2310` having around 27.5 % of the overall budget.


5. Recalculate the quantities

    - Now that you have adjusted the revenue budget, you need to refresh the quantities in order for the data in the model to be correct. 
    - Click on the **Recalculate Quantities** button to recalculate all quantities based on the new revenue.
  
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](6/14.png)


6. Publish or revert your version

    - Click on the **Confirm** or **Reset** button in order to publish or revert your plan data.
    
    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - By publishing the version, all users with sufficient rights will be able to see your edits in the version you were working on.
    - As soon as you start editing a public version, a private version is created in the background, which only you can see. All edits you do are done on this private version. Thus your work-in-progress is only visible to you.
    - It is possible to leave the story and resume your work on another day without losing your progress.
    - Only after publishing the version your changes will be written to the public version and will be visible to all other users.
    - Learn more about the concept of planning on public versions in our [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/b6e3d093988e4c3eba7eb6c1c110e954.html?q=version)

[OPTION END]

### Marketing Demand Planning
Now that the budget is planned, you can continue with your planning activities on the `Plan` version. Please note that the overall planning process is not considered to be linear or to be performed successively. It is rather an iterative process, so it does not matter whether you start your planning activities by using this story or any other planning story of this content package. 

In this step, the **Marketing Demand Planning** (`SAP_MKT_MarketingDemandPlanning`) story of this content package is introduced.

You will learn how to open the story (Tab 1) and how to enter your planning assumptions (Tab 2).

    - The story consists of three sections. 
    - The header section provides two charts showing the the total gross revenue and the total quantity by year. 
    - The context for all charts is defined by the filters set in the input controls on the left-hand side of the story. 
    - The (total) gross revenue or respectively (total) quantity residing on the plan version is displayed as a bar, while the baseline quantity and baseline revenue is indicated by the triangle below the bars. 
    - The red or respectively green bars (depending on whether the deviation is positive or negative) show the variance between the `Plan` and the `Budget` version.

    - The second important section is the left-side panel, which can be found on the left-hand side of the application. 
    - Per default the filter panel is opened. It provides input controls in which you can define your planning context for this story.
    - By clicking on the icons on the very left, you can change the context of the panel to either show comments or the driver table. 

    - The last important section is the planning section in the center of the story. 
    - The planning table is the place where you can enter your planning assumptions.
    - You can either plan revenues or quantities. The entry is only allowed on a Totals level in order to keep the distribution between the different drivers equal. 
  
You may now switch to the second tab **Enter Plan Data** to learn how to enter your planning assumptions.

[OPTION END]


[OPTION BEGIN [Enter Plan Data]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Enter Plan Data**. This tab provides guidance on how to enter your plan data and how to plan the drivers.

1. Adjust your filters in the filter panel.
   
    - According to the **Steps** description field, start your activities by adjusting your filters in the filter panel if required. 
    
    >INFORMATION:

2. Adjust the total revenue

    - Click on any editable cell to adjust the planned revenue and enter a new number. 

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - In this story, planning assumptions can only be entered on the totals level. It is not possible to adjust the absolute values for each driver individually.
    - If you want to change your baseline revenue, you can only do so by manipulating the value in the totals row. 
    - If you want to change the values of the price impact or the campaign uplift driver, you have to jump into the respective stories to do so.
    - In order to change the price impact driver, please visit the **List Price Planning** story. For the campaign lift driver, visit the **Marketing Campaign Planning** story. For the consumer trend and market share driver, a detailed description will be provided later in this step. 

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](7/5.png)

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](7/9.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - In some cases you might experience that your entered value is slightly adjusted after the calculation.
    - This is because the executed data action contains a step in which your incremental quantities are refreshed based on the maintained quantity impact percentage values first to ensure data integrity. 
    - As `Quantity` is an integer measure while `Quantity Impact (%)` is a decimal measure, results are stored as integer values consequently which leads to the slight adjustments you might experience. 

7. Adjust the market share and consumer trend drivers

    - In order to adjust the drivers, click on the little chart icon in the left-side panel.
    - A table will open up where you can maintain your drivers on a product group level.

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Reporting]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Reporting**. This tab provides information about the navigation concept of the story and the reported data.

1. **Filter** panel

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](9/4.png)

    - These filters define the entire context for the reporting story. 
    - Different from the filter panels in the planning stories where the panel is created manually, this panel is an SAC in-built filter panel. 
    - If you close the filter panel, you will not have the left-side panel visible anymore. Instead, you have to go to the header of the story and click on the filter icon to display the filter panel again.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](9/5.png)


2. **Header** section

    - In the header section you can find three graphs that provide you with high level insights.
    - Next to the graphs, you can find more detailed information about the context in a descriptive form. 
    - The text on the left-hand side applies not only to the header graphs, but to all charts of this story.
    
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](9/6.png)

    - The **Incremental Gross Revenue** graph shows the gross revenue of the current selection made in the filter section. 
    - The **Marketing Expenses** graph shows the marketing expenses and the planned marketing activity costs of the current selection made in the filter section.

    - The **Planned Campaign vs. Activity Costs** graph shows the marketing expenses in relation to the marketing activity costs per month under consideration of the current selection made in the filter panel.
    - The **Planned Net Revenue over Time** graph shows the net revenue per month under consideration of the current selection made in the filter panel as bar charts, while the colors of the bar chart show which portion comes from the baseline driver and which portion comes from campaign planning related activities.
    - The **Planned Activity Costs** chart shows the activity costs per activity under consideration of the current selection made in the filter panel as bar charts.
    - The **Return on Investment per Product** graph shows the ROI per product under consideration of the current selection made in the filter panel as bar chart.
    - The **Campaign Comments** display commentary you entered when creating and editing the currently-selected campaign.
    - The **Additional Comments** section provides a place where you can leave additional comments for yourself or your colleagues. 

4. **ROI view** mode

    - Click on the button **Switch to ROI view** to enter the tabular point of view. 
   
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](9/8.png)

    - You can now consume the report in a tabular instead of a graphical view.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](9/9.png)

    - Again, the context of the table is defined by the selections made in the filter panel. 
    - Using the table, you can drill into different G/L Accounts and compare your revenues with your expenses on a campaign level. 
    - In addition to that you can also check the ROI per product by consuming the in-cell graphs in the table.

[OPTION END]


### Marketing Performance Analysis
In this step the **Marketing Performance Analysis** (`SAP_MKT_MarketingPerformanceAnalysis`) story of this content package is introduced. 

Here you will learn how to open the story (Tab 1) and how to consume the different reports to get an overview about your marketing performance and all important financial metrics (Tab 2).

[OPTION BEGIN [Open Story]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Open Story**. This tab provides guidance on how to open the **Marketing Performance Analysis** (`SAP_MKT_MarketingPerformanceAnalysis`) story.

1. If you still have the **Marketing Campaign Analysis** story opened from the previous step, click on the burger menu located on the top left corner to open the navigation panel.

2. Now click on either **Marketing Planning** to jump back to the **Marketing Planning Overview Page** or on **Marketing Performance Analysis** to directly access the **Marketing Performance Analysis** story. 

    - In this particular case, we will go back to the **Marketing Planning Overview Page** by clicking on the **Marketing Planning** button.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/1.png)
    
3. Click on the link **Marketing Performance Analysis** to enter the story.

    - This story supports the marketing planning process and provides detailed insights into income and expense topics. 
    - It provides different modes where you can inspect your revenues, costs or margins per version in detail.
    - In addition to that, the report can be consumed in a tabular or graphical view by using the switch button on the top right corner of the reporting section. 

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Reporting]]
Currently, you have opened the tab **Reporting**. This tab provides information about the navigation concept of the story and the reported data.

1. **Filter** panel

    - When you open the story, you can see a filter panel on the left-hand side of the story where you can define the context of the story. 
    - These settings are applied on the entire story.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/4.png)

    - In addition to the filter settings, you can also switch between a local currency or global currency point of view in this panel. 
    - In order to do so, click on the last drop down and select either **Local Currency** or **Global Currency**.
  
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/5.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    - When you switch to the local currency mode, please make sure to select only **one** company code in the company code input control inside the filter panel.
    - Otherwise you may receive misleading results as SAC aggregates the raw numbers as they are stored in the data model over all company codes, which can be critical when company codes use different currencies.

2. **Header** section

    - In the header section you can find three graphs that provide you with high level insights.
    
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/6.png)

    - The **Gross Revenue per Date** graph shows the gross revenue under consideration of the current selection made in the filter section across multiple versions. All versions apart from the `Budget` version are displayed as a bar, while the `Budget version` itself is represented by the small triangle.  
    - The **Marketing Expenses per Date** graph shows the marketing expenses under consideration of the current selection made in the filter section across multiple versions. All versions apart from the `Budget` version are displayed as a bar, while the `Budget version` itself is represented by the small triangle.  
    - The **Gross Margin per Date** graph shows the gross margin under consideration of the current selection made in the filter section across multiple versions. All versions apart from the `Budget` version are displayed as a bar, while the `Budget version` itself is represented by the small triangle.  

3. **Detailed Analysis Breakdown** section

    - This section provides deeper insights into key metrics and allows you to analyze your marketing activities and versions in more detail. 
    
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/7.png)

    - To change the displayed version, use the drop down widget located in the header of the breakdown section.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/8.png)

    - To change the displayed measure, use the drop down widget located in the header of the breakdown section.
    
    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/9.png)

    - Per default, the view is set to **Gross Revenue**.
    - The **Gross Revenue per Date, Product** graph on the left-hand side shows the gross revenue per year and product group under consideration of the current selection made in the filter panel for all versions.
    - The **Gross Revenue per Date, Product** graph in the center shows the gross revenue per year and product group under consideration of the current selection made in the filter panel for only the selected version, while the gross revenue is depicted as one bar, split into different colors where the colors represent the product groups. 
    - The **Gross Revenue per Company Code** shows the gross revenue split between the different company codes in percent under consideration of the current selection made in the filter panel.
    - If you now switch the measure by using the drop down in the header line to show marketing expenses, you will see the exact same reports, but focussing on marketing expenses instead of the gross revenue.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/10.png)

    - The same applies when you switch to the gross margin view. Now the graphs will show you the gross margin instead of marketing expenses or the gross revenue.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/11.png)

4. **Table View** mode

    - Lastly, you also have the possibility to switch over from a graphical mode to a tabular mode by using the **Tabular View** button on the top right corner.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/12.png)

    - The table displays the revenues and costs per product and version and also contains some in-cell graphs to compare the versions. 
    - You can drill down along the product hierarchy or the account hierarchy to receive deeper insights. 

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xp&A Commercial Planning](10/13.png)
