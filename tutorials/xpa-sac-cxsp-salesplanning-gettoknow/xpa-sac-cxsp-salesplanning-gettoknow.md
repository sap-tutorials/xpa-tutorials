### Access SAC Contents

In this step you will learn how to navigate to the folder which contains all SAP Analytic Cloud content packages.

1. Login to your SAP Analytics Cloud tenant using **Google Chrome**.

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    In order to get the best experience, it is recommended to use **Google Chrome** as it offers the best compatibility with SAC. Other browsers can be used as well but are not supported by SAP.

2. In the SAP Analytics Cloud Menu, navigate to the **Files** section.

    <!-- border; size:300px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](1/1.png)

3. Access the content package folder.

    - You can access the content package folder by either navigating to the `Public` folder first and looking for a folder named `SAP_CONTENT`, or by using the **search function** in the top-right corner.
    - In case you want to make use of the search function, simply enter the term `SAP_CONTENT` into the search bar.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](1/2.png)

    - The folder `SAP_CONTENT` contains all objects required to run SAC content. Here you can find your installed content from the content network provided by SAP.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](1/3.png)

### Access Sales Planning Content

Now that you learned where all the SAP Analytics Cloud content packages are stored, you need to find the Sales Planning content within the **SAP Commercial Planning (CX)** content package.

1. Look for the **SAP Sales Planning (SP)** content by using the search bar.

    - In order to do so, please use the keyword `xP&A` or `SD`
    - In the result list, click on the folder `SAP_SD_Sales_Planning` with the description `xP&A â€“ SAP Sales Planning`

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](2/1.png)

2. Run the Sales Planning content package.

    - The folder `SAP_SD_Sales_Planning` contains all planning applications and the reporting story.
    - To run the Sales Planning content, please click on the folder `Stories` and on the application called **Sales Planning Overview Page** (`SAP_SD_SalesPlanning_Overview`).

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](2/2.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    The application `SAP_SD_SalesPlanning_Overview` serves as a starting point and allows you to access all of the other resources during run time. In other words, you do not need to access the remaining applications by manually launching them from the **Files** section. Instead, you can open them from inside the `SAP_SD_SalesPlanning_Overview` application.

### Sales Planning Content Overview

Before jumping into the different applications which are accessible through the landing page of this content package, it is necessary to understand what the individual applications are for and which use cases they cover.

    - This description field serves as a rough guideline and describes the intended workflow within each of the planning applications.

### Application Configuration

Now that you are familiar with the basics and the navigation concept, you will learn in more detail how to use the different planning applications.
This step focuses on the **Admin Page** (`SAP_SD_SalesPlanning_AdminPage`) application.
You will learn how to open the story, trigger initialization logic and how to setup mappings.

>INFORMATION:
>
You only need to perform the initialization steps for the data if you want to work with your own data. You can work with the pre-built data for the time being as well and initialize your data from your source systems later.

1. Open **Business Admin tasks**

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/1.png)

    - Open **Sales Planning Overview Page** (`SAP_SD_SalesPlanning_Overview`).
    - Click on **Business Admin tasks** in the Configure section in order to land on the related tab of the Admin Page.

2. Familiarize yourself with the application

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/2.png)

    - Get an overview of the application and read the instructions.
    - All planning applications provide a short in-built step by step guide which helps you to use the corresponding application correctly.
    - Before using the application, make sure to check the Instructions field to understand the intended workflow.
    - This tab contains the data actions and multi actions available in the system for the Sales Planning process. By triggering the dedicated logic, you are able to clear versions, import data from external and internal sources, and calculate the relevant Profit and Loss figures.
    - The **Utilities** section offers a function to delete all the data and all measures on all combinations existing on the version selected as a Target Version.
    - The **Load Data** area provides functions to load prices, baseline quantities or COGS rates from external data sources or data models.
    - The remaining areas **Calculate Data** and **Individual Actions** cover all other data actions and multi actions which are automatically called during the usage of the stories related to the sales planning.

3. Setup your data

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/3.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    Please note, that the following steps assume, that you have already setup your data for Marketing Planning. The following steps are building on top of it. Please note as well, that you need to maintain the **HTTP API Connection** and **API URL** of your **SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP)** system in the multi action `Multiaction importing IBP Baseline Quantities` (`SAP_SD_IM_InboundBaselineQuantitiesFromIBP`). Otherwise, you will get a warning that you need to fix errors in the multi action designer.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/6.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    This is mentioned error screen you receive when triggering the multi action **Baseline Quantities** without proper configuration. The link will take you to the multi action to maintain the needed details.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/7.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    Click on the step or exclamation mark to open the details of the step. You can see the missing fields for **HTTP API Connection** and **API URL**. This and more will be explained in [xP&A Commercial Planning - How to set up system connections](xpa-sac-cx-data-integration-setup).

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    Additionally, please note, that you need to have [Integrated Financial Planning for S/4HANA](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/42093f14b43c485fbe3adbbe81eff6c8/4922aae688c543c5863a70c1316694d5.html). Follow the [Business Content Installation Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/078868f57f3346a98c3233207bd211c7.html) to install it. You can learn more about the details of data mapping of the actual transaction data from SAP S/4HANA (`A_JournalEntryItemBasicQuery`) to SAC Sales Planning model (`SAP_SD_IM_SalesPlanning`) in the [Content Package User Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/42093f14b43c485fbe3adbbe81eff6c8/fe65801fd2e6487686ed0329d830f136.html#data-mapping-for-%5Bactual-data%5D-a_journalentryitembasicquery).

    - Run the data action **List Prices** by selecting **public.Budget** as source version (or whichever version from the Marketing model you wish to use as the source for List Prices) and **public.plan** as target version and the corresponding time range for which you have data in your marketing planning data model. The data action first deletes the prices on **public.plan** version of the Sales Planning model. Then it copies the existing prices of Marketing Planning model for the selected time range into the **public.plan** version.
    - If you have already configured the SAP Integrated Business Planning import job as specified in [xP&A Commercial Planning - How to set up system connections](xpa-sac-cx-data-integration-setup), then you can trigger the import of **Baseline Quantities** from **SAP Integrated Business Planning** into the **public.plan** version of Sales Planning Model.
    - Run the data action **COGS Rates from Product Costing** with **public.plan** as target version. It deletes the existing COGS Rates on **public.plan** version of Sales Planning model for the selected date range and copies to that version the COGS Rates existing in the **public.plan** version of Product Cost model from **SAP Integrated Financial Planning** package for the selected time range.
    - Run the multi action **Revenue, COGS and Activities** with **public.plan** as target version. It deletes existing baseline revenues and COGS for **public.plan** version and recalculates them by multiplying quantity and price on Revenue GL Account and by multiplying updated Quantities by the respective COGS Rates respectively. As a subsequent step this multi action refreshes the calculations of all existing activities to ensure return of investment and required metrics are up to date.

4. Open Spend Type - Tactic - GL Account Mapping from the Overview page

    Now, that the data is loaded into the data model, you are going to have a look how to adjust **Spend Type - Tactic - GL Account Mapping**.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/1.png)

    - Go back to the **Sales Planning Overview Page** (`SAP_SD_SalesPlanning_Overview`).
    - Click on **Spend Type - Tactic - GL Account Mapping** in the Configure section in order to land on the related tab of the Admin Page.

5. Open Spend Type - Tactic - GL Account Mapping from the Business Admin tasks page

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/4.png)

    - Move your mouse to the top of the page and wait for the navigation menu to appear.
    - Click on **Mapping** to open **Spend Type - Tactic - GL Account Mapping** page.

6. Define mapping

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/5.png)

    - This tab allows for the review and adjustment of the existing mapping between `SpendType`, `Tactic` and `GL Account` of a specific activity. It enables you to drive the objectives of your organization by prioritizing on certain combinations.
    - The table displays the current mapping Spend Type - Tactic - GL Account of an activity.
    - Use the filter panel on the left-hand side to select the desired combination of Spend Type and Tactic to be mapped.
    - Adjust the mapping in the table by cancelling the value stored on a specific combination into the Driver column and input "1" on the Spend Account to be used for the Spend Type - Tactic combination of an activity.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/8.png)

    - For example, apply a filter in the left panel on `SpendType` on `Rebate Percentage` and on `Tactic` on `Price`. The main table will filter down to a single row.
    - Right-click on `GL Account`.
    - Click on **Show/Hide** and check **Unbooked**.
    - You can then drill down on `Sales Deduction` and edit the driver column to add a "1" next to the desired G/L Account for the `SpendType`-`Tactic`-combination.
    - Confirm or Reset the adjustment through the dedicated buttons.

7. Open **Customer-Product selection** from the Overview page

    You can now switch to the Customer-Product selection tab after you are done with your mapping.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/1.png)

    - Go back to the **Sales Planning Overview Page** (`SAP_SD_SalesPlanning_Overview`).
    - Click on **Customer-Product selection for Activities** in the Configure section in order to land on the related tab of the Admin Page.

8. Open the **Customer-Product selection** page

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](5/4.png)

    - Move your mouse to the top of the page and wait for the navigation menu to appear.
    - Click on **Customer-Product selection** to open **Customer-Product selection for Activities** page.
    - This tab allows for the review of the original customer product combination selected by the user while creating a new activity.
    - The report is used for debugging purpose and should not be relevant by now. But in case anything goes amiss for customer, product and activity combinations you can double check on this report.

### Global Sales Budget Planning

As you have now cleared the planning scenario, imported prices, COGS and volumes and mapped the different dimension combinations, you can continue with the actual planning activities.
In the next steps the Sales Planning stories of this content package are introduced.

1. Open **Global Sales Budget Planning** (`SAP_SD_SalesBudgetPlanningGlobal`) from the Sales Planning Overview Page

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/1.png)

    - Go to the **Sales Planning Overview Page** (`SAP_SD_SalesPlanning_Overview`).
    - Click on **Global Sales Budget** in the Plan section in order to land on the **Global Sales Budget Planning** (`SAP_SD_SalesBudgetPlanningGlobal`) application.

2. Understand the application

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/2.png)

    - The application consists of four sections.
    - In the middle at the top, you can read the instructions to understand the workflow of this application.
    - On the left-hand side of the page, you can find the filter panel, that allows you to select the desired combination of Date, Company Code, Sales Organization, Customer and Product that will be reflected on the charts and the planning table.
    - In the top right section, you can find charts that show Global Budget Gross Revenue, Spend and Gross Margin in the Global currency for the selected year. The amounts of the **Global Budget** (`BudgetL1`) version are compared to the **Financial Target** (`FinancialTarget`) version displayed as variance.
    - In the lower section, you can find the planning table where you can adjust Gross Revenue and Spend and recalculate the Quantity. On the right side of the table a commentary widget gives you and your colleagues the chance to collaborate. You can add comments during the planning phase.

3. **Initialization** of the Global Budget

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/3.png)

    - Click on the button **Initialize Global Budget** to copy data from **Financial Target** (`FinancialTarget`) version to **Global Budget** (`BudgetL1`) version. It clears all data on the **Global Budget** (`BudgetL1`) version for the selected time range and copies the Financial Target data for the selected time range.

4. Select **Initialization Year**

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/4.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    Ignore the warning triangle in the pop-up **Select Initialization Year** which warns you that the input control widget is not connected to any other widget. Technically, the warning is correct and comes by default for an input control without a connection to another widget in the story. However, this input control widget serves as year selector for the to be executed data action and has its impact as you will see in a second.

    - Select a year to copy the data from the **Financial Target** (`FinancialTarget`) version to your **Global Budget** (`BudgetL1`) version and click **Done**.
    - Note the yellow highlighting in your table as the values have changed

5. **Plan the Global Budget** by adjusting **Table Settings**

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/5.png)

    - Click on **Table Settings**.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/6.png)

    - Check the **Reference Version 1** and select the **Financial Target** in the drop down menu.
    - With this change you can compare the difference between your planned and original amount for gross revenue and sales deduction, which you will change in the next steps.
    - This makes it more transparent for you to understand the variance in the charts, which will grow based on your changes on the BudgetL1 version.
    - Click on **OK** once you are done.
    - Note that the table has a Financial Target column for each GL Account and Measure.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/7.png)

6. Plan **Gross Revenue**

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/8.png)

    - You are a global sales leader who wants to increase the sales revenue by a lot.
    - Change the filter on the left side to the year you want to plan and show all data for Company Code, Sales Organization, Customer and Product.
    - Click in the cell of line **Total** as **Sales Organization**, **Total Bikes** as **Product** and of column **2024** as **Date**, **Gross Revenue** as **GL Account**, **Amount @ Budget** as Measures and **BudgetL1** as **Version**.
    - Increase the value by roughly **+7%**. In this example you see the value of **550.000.000,00 USD**.
    - Notice the change happening to the charts at the top and in the table highlighted yellow, once you press enter. The variance **Global Budget (L1) versus Financial Target** for **Gross Revenue** and **Gross Margin** increases and is therefore colored green. The **GL Account** **Investment Rate %** reacts on your change as well.

7. Plan **Sales Deduction**

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/9.png)

    - In order to achieve the increase in revenue you are willing to increase the spend budget by an even bigger amount.
    - Click in the cell of line **Total** as **Sales Organization**, **Total Bikes** as **Product** and of column **2024** as **Date**, **Sales Deduction** as **GL Account**, **Amount @ Budget** as Measures and **BudgetL1** as **Version**.
    - Increase the value by roughly **+10%**. In this example you see the value of **40.000.000,00 USD**.
    - Notice the change happening to the charts at the top and in the table highlighted yellow, once you press enter. The variance **Global Budget (L1) versus Financial Target** for **Spend** increases and is therefore colored red. Once again, the **GL Account** **Investment Rate %** reacts on your change.

8. **Calculate Quantity**

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/10.png)

    - The measure **Quantity** has not reacted at all on your changes. You can take this step once you are done with your planning of **Gross Revenue** and **Sales Deduction**.
    - Click on the button **Calculate Quantity**.
    - The quantity units increase according to the changes you made in the previous steps as you can see in the highlighted yellow area.

9. **Publish** your version **Global Budget** (`BudgetL1`)

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](6/11.png)

    - You adjusted the amount of **Gross Revenue** and **Sales Deduction** and the **Investment Rate %** and **Quantity** units followed suit.
    - Now it is time to publish your new planned data as version **Global Budget** (`BudgetL1`).
    - Check your data one last time.
    - Click on the button **Confirm**.
    - Confirm your intentions by pressing **OK**.

    You have successfully planned your Global Sales Revenue and Spend Budget.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](7/6.png)

    - Check the **Reference Version 1** and select the **Global Budget** (`BudgetL1`) in the drop down menu.
    - With this change you can compare the difference between your planned and original amount for gross revenue and sales deduction, which you will change in the next steps.
    - This makes it more transparent for you to understand the variance in the charts, which will grow based on your changes on the **Regional Budget** (`BudgetL2`) version.
    - Click on **OK** once you are done.
    - Note that the table has a **Global Budget** column for each GL Account and Measure.

8. **Calculate Quantity**

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](7/11.png)

    >INFORMATION:
    >
    Incremental quantities refer to the amount of products sold during a specific period of time that exceeds the baseline quantity of your business. This difference is typically attributed to the implementation of a specific promotional sales activity. The concept of incremental quantity can also be used by you as a key performance indicator (KPI) to assess the effectiveness of marketing efforts.

    - Click in the cell of line **Total Customers** as **Customer**, **Cruise** as **Product**, **Baseline** as **Type**, **Piece** as **Quantity Unit** and of column **Plan** as **Version**, **2024** as **Date** and **Quantity** as **Measure**.

### Sales Activity Planning

Now you are ready to perform the tasks of a sales activity manager.  You will create a new sales activity for your region and approve an existing sales activity.

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](9/1.png)

    - Go to the **Sales Planning Overview Page** (`SAP_SD_SalesPlanning_Overview`).
    - Click on **Sales Activity Planning** in the Plan section in order to land on the **Sales Activity Planning** (`SAP_SD_SalesActivityPlanning`) application.

2. Understand the application

    <!-- border; size:540px -->![xP&A Sales Planning](9/2.png)

    - The application consists of four sections.
    - In the middle at the top, you can read the instructions to understand the workflow of this application.
    - On the left-hand side of the page, you can find the filter panel, that allows you to select the desired combination of Date, Company Code, Customer, Product and Status (Sales Planning) that will be reflected on the charts and the planning table.
    - In the top right section, you can find charts that show Gross Revenue, Spend and Gross Margin. The amounts of the **Plan** are compared to the **Budget** version displayed as variance.
    - In the lower section, you can find the planning table where you can create, edit, copy and cancel sales activities and see their **Return of Investment**.

    > Information:
    >
    You cannot calculate the **Return of Investment** based on the measure you can see on the screen. You need the measure `Cost of Goods Sold` to calculate it, but he table does not display it. Additionally, the measure amount for `Gross Revenue` is the sum of activity incremental amount and activity prorated baseline amount.
    However, the **Return of Investment** is calculated based on incremental amounts generated by sales activities. The **Return on Investment** formula is as following:
    `Return on Investment = (Incremental Gross Sales - Incremental Cost of Goods Sold - Sales Deductions)/Sales Deductions`
    If you want to confirm the **Return of Investment** values you can switch to the **Sales Activity Return on Investment Report** (`SAP_SD_SalesActivityROI`) application and read the respective chapter in this guide to learn more about **Return of Investment**. Note, the **Return of Investment** reported in **Sales Activity Planning** (`SAP_SD_SalesActivityPlanning`) and **Sales Activity Return on Investment Report** (`SAP_SD_SalesActivityROI`) are consistent.
